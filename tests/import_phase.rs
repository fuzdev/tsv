//! Formatter coverage for the Stage-3 import-phase proposals — source-phase
//! imports (`import source …` / `import.source(…)`) and import defer
//! (`import defer * as ns …` / `import.defer(…)`).
//!
//! The *parser* is graded by the test262 suite (see `docs/conformance_test262.md`);
//! these tests cover the *printer*, which test262 never exercises. acorn rejects
//! this syntax, so there is no fixture parse oracle, and prettier either drops the
//! phase (`import defer`) or throws (`import source`) — so these can't be fixtures
//! either. Each test asserts a single-pass stable round-trip plus idempotency.
//!
//! The prettier divergences are cataloged in `docs/conformance_prettier.md` and
//! `docs/conformance_svelte.md`. The `import source` form (prettier throws) is
//! also live-pinned in `tests/prettier_error_bugs.rs`; the `import defer` form
//! (prettier silently drops the phase) is documented-only — a live "prettier
//! succeeds with wrong output" assertion would gate the suite on a sidecar call
//! under load, which is needless fragility for a niche Stage-3 divergence.
//!
//! One test also pins a *parser* divergence that the fixture/test262 path can't
//! reach (the spec-valid input is a `_FIXTURE.js`, never graded): a source-phase
//! binding whose name lexes as a contextual keyword. See
//! `static_import_source_keyword_binding_rejected`.
