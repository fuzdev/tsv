/**
 * dprint implementation wrapper (via WASM)
 *
 * `dprint-plugin-typescript` is the engine **`deno fmt` runs** for TS/JS, loaded
 * here in-process as its Wasm plugin rather than by shelling out to the `deno`
 * CLI. That choice is deliberate on two axes:
 *
 * - **Runtime neutrality.** A `deno fmt` subprocess row would exist only under
 *   Deno, against a harness whose whole design is one body across three runtimes
 *   (see benches/js/CLAUDE.md §Cross-Runtime). The Wasm plugin loads under Deno,
 *   Node, AND Bun — verified — so this is a full three-runtime row, unlike
 *   `biome-wasm` / `oxc-parser-wasm` (neither loads under Bun).
 * - **It would measure the wrong thing.** The harness times one file at a time in
 *   a warm in-process loop; a fresh `deno` process per file would be dominated by
 *   spawn + IPC, not format work, and would be cold on every call against warm
 *   opponents.
 *
 * So the row is named for what it actually measures — the dprint engine — not
 * `deno fmt`, whose CLI wrapping (config discovery, file IO, its own CSS/HTML/
 * markdown plugins) is not in scope here.
 *
 * Supports: TypeScript/JS only. `@dprint/typescript` matches
 * `ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,mts,cts` and rejects CSS/Svelte outright (verified), so
 * unlike `oxfmt`/`biome` this contributes no css or svelte row. dprint's CSS
 * (malva) and HTML plugins are separate Wasm plugins, deliberately not wired up.
