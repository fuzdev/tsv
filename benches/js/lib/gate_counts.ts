/**
 * Pinned gate counts — committed EXPECTED numbers for the diagnostic gates and
 * harvests, so a change in what gets graded (a gutted or refreshed suite
 * checkout, a discovery bug, a tsv behavior change, a systemic sidecar/FFI
 * failure eating a whole language) fails loudly instead of shifting inside a
 * green run. This is `scripts/validate_artifacts.ts`'s tight-bounds philosophy
 * applied to counts: every real move in a number is a deliberate, visible edit.
 *
 * Three pin categories, chosen per surface:
 *
 * - **Exact pins** (`*_PINS` / `*_PIN`) — surfaces whose inputs are pinned or
 *   committed: the fixtures gates and harvests (suite checkouts version-gated
 *   by `deno task pins:audit`) and ts-repo/test262/wpt (checkouts updated
 *   deliberately). Any mismatch — up or down — fails. No slack: slack lets
 *   small regressions creep and silently widens after every refresh.
 * - **Minimums** (`*_MIN`) — success counts on the live `corpus:compare:*
 *   --all` corpus (dev repos that grow with ordinary work) and the
 *   committed-fixtures audits (additions are ordinary reviewed diffs). Growth
 *   passes; any drop below the pinned current value fails — except
 *   `SVELTE_STYLES_BLOCKS_MIN`, which counts pure input material off
 *   daily-churning repos, so a small drop only warns and only a >10% collapse
 *   fails (see its comment).
 * - **Failure-bucket pins** (`*_PIN`, exact — the same two-sided `!==` as the
 *   exact pins above, but on the live corpus rather than a deterministic
 *   input): the triage buckets on `corpus:compare:* --all` (unknown/partial
 *   divergences, tsv-side parse failures). A rise fails until triaged — fix
 *   it, add a divergence detector/sanction, or consciously re-pin (a
 *   legitimately-unsupported new corpus file); a drop (bucket shrank —
 *   divergences fixed) also fails, so the pin ratchets DOWN deliberately and
 *   wins stay recorded.
 *
 * Pins are enforced only on FULL runs (default suite root, `--all`, default
 * harvest source) — a subtree or filtered run legitimately grades a slice.
 * Harvest pins fail BEFORE writing, so a wrong cache never replaces a good
 * one (the `SVELTE_STYLES_BLOCKS_MIN` drift band still holds this: only a
 * collapse fails-before-writing; a small shrink warns and writes valid data).
 * CI note: `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs on a clean checkout (no
 * sibling clones), so of these only the committed-tree Rust pins
 * (fixtures_validate via the integration test, swallow_audit) execute in CI —
 * the rest are dev-machine gates at conformance/publish cadence.
 *
 * Update ritual: the failure message prints expected vs got — update the
 * constant + its measured-on comment (INCLUDING the checkout commit, `git -C
 * ../<repo> rev-parse --short HEAD` — upstream version files only bump at
 * release, so the commit is the only precise statement of what a pin was
 * measured against) in the same change, and say why in the commit message.
 * When re-pinning after a suite refresh, glance at the full bucket table, not
 * just the changed number — a count move can mask offsetting changes (the
 * per-file gates — unexpected over-rejections, stale ledgers, SAFETY — catch
 * tsv-side regressions independently, but the glance is cheap). A
 * failure-bucket-pin trip on a single `--all` run can be the known FFI/sidecar
 * heisenbug (see
 * benches/js/CLAUDE.md §Known Issues) — confirm on the single repo before
 * treating it as real. Never re-pin to absorb an unexplained move.
 *
 * The Rust-side pins (test262 discovery + graded manifest, `fixtures_validate`
 * fixture count, `swallow_audit` formatted-file count) live as consts in their
 * commands — grep `REGRESSION PIN`. See benches/js/CLAUDE.md §Pinned gate
 * counts.

 * over-rejection to both-accept.
