# tsv_svelte_compile

> Svelte-to-JS compiler (pinned to Svelte's `compile()` as oracle) plus the JavaScript canonicalizer that makes oracle comparison meaningful.

## Architecture Position

Depends on:

- [`tsv_lang`](../tsv_lang/CLAUDE.md) — `ParseError`, `Span`, the shared interner
- `tsv_svelte` — component parsing (`parse`) and the internal Svelte AST the transform walks
- `tsv_ts` — the internal TS AST the generator constructs, plus `parse_with_goal` and the canonical reprint (`format_canonical`)
- `tsv_css` — the parsed stylesheet the scoping analysis reads
- `tsv_html` — element classification (void elements)

Oracle: Svelte's own `compile()`. The compiler is measured against it not on raw
output bytes but on the *canonical reprint* of both sides (see the canonicalizer
contract below).

See [../../CLAUDE.md §Project Structure](../../CLAUDE.md#project-structure) for
project-wide conventions.

## Module Map

- `lib.rs` — the public API in the tsv free-function pattern:
  - `compile(source, &CompileOptions) -> Result<CompileOutput, CompileError>` —
    parses the component and runs the server transform. Generated JS prints
    through `format_canonical`, so it is canonical-form by construction
    (`canonicalize_js(output.js)` is a fixed point). The control-flow blocks
    `{#if}`/`{#each}`/`{#await}`/`{#key}`, `{@const}`, `{#snippet}`/`{@render}`,
    and **static component invocations** (`<Foo … />` →
    `Foo($$renderer, {…props})` / `$.spread_props`, with default-slot children as
    the implicit `children` snippet prop and `{#snippet}` children as named
    snippet props; dynamic/member components, named slots, `bind:`/`--css-var`/
    directives refuse) are covered (see the transform_server block emitters
    below). Shapes
    the transform does not cover yet — client generation, dev mode,
    instance-script exports in every *value* form (the oracle compiles
    `export const`/`function`/`{a}` via `$.bind_props`, not implemented; rejects
    `export default`/`export let` — a *type-only* export erases away and
    compiles), `generics`, a `lang` other than `"ts"`/`"js"`/`""` (the oracle's
    TypeScript flag tests `lang === 'ts'` exactly, so `lang="typescript"` is
    plain JS to it — tsv refuses rather than guess), TypeScript in a document
    with no `ts` flag (tsv's parser is TS-permissive where the oracle
    parse-errors — an over-acceptance), a comment
    inside an erased TypeScript region, the refuse-don't-erase TypeScript set
    (`enum` incl. `declare enum`, a value `namespace`, a constructor parameter
    property, a decorator, an `accessor` field, an `abstract` *property*, a
    bodiless class method, a class index signature, `import =`/`export =`/`export
    as namespace` — the last four are shapes the oracle mis-compiles into invalid
    JS), top-level `$:` legacy reactive
    statements (invalid in runes mode — a nested `$` label or a plain label is
    ordinary JS and clones through), `svelte/internal*` imports and
    `beforeUpdate`/`afterUpdate` imports from `svelte` (the oracle's runes-mode
    import rules), `{@debug}`, the deliberately-refused legacy attribute directives
    (a legacy `on:` directive and `let:` — a runes-only fence, not a gap) — an element `{...spread}` (alone, or
    co-present with `class:` / `style:` / `bind:` / the no-op drop family) is
    **emitted** as the fused
    `$.attributes(object, css_hash, classes, styles, flags)` call
    (`element.rs::emit_spread_attributes`): the whole attribute set becomes the
    object (plain attributes → `key: value` properties, a `bind:` core kind →
    its synthesized `value`/`checked` property at the bind's slot, event handlers /
    `defaultValue` dropped, spreads → `...expr`), the scope hash rides the
    `css_hash` argument (not concatenated into the class value as in the
    non-spread path; a static-class token OR a `class:` directive name scopes),
    the `class:` directives ride the `classes` argument (the oracle's
    `b.init(name, expr)` — identifier keys, case-preserved, with the
    object-shorthand collapse — `attribute::build_spread_class_object`), the
    `style:` directives ride the `styles` argument (a **FLAT** object, **no**
    `|important` partitioning — the divergence from the non-spread
    `$.attr_style` array — `attribute::build_spread_style_object`), and `<input>`
    / a custom element set the `flags` argument
    (trailing absent args elide, interior ones become `void 0`); a spread
    co-present with a legacy `on:`/`let:` refuses (`Refusal::NonPlainAttribute`),
    and a spread on a `<select>` (the `$$renderer.select`
    trap) or on a load-error element refuses (`SpreadOnSelect` /
    `SpreadOnLoadErrorElement`) — a `class:` / `style:`
    directive on a **regular element without a spread** is
    instead **emitted** as the fused `$.attr_class(base, hash, {…})` /
    `$.attr_style(base, {…})` call (`element.rs` /
    `attribute.rs`), and a `bind:` **core kind** on a regular element without a
    spread is
    **handled** by `attribute::emit_bind_directive` (`bind:this` omits;
    `bind:value`/`bind:checked`/`bind:group` on `<input>` synthesize a
    `$.attr(...)` for a `$state`-rooted target; every other `bind:` refuses via
    `Refusal::BindDirective { name }`) — both the inline and spread `bind:` paths
    share one `attribute::resolve_bind_directive` validity fork; the no-op drop
    family (`use:`/`transition:`/`in:`/`out:`/
    `animate:`/`{@attach}`) is instead **dropped** on a regular element, its
    expression still guarded (a stray rune / `await` refuses) and still walked for
    scope analysis, except a `use:` on a load-error element, which refuses because
    the oracle adds `onload`/`onerror` capture attributes there —
    top-level `await`,
    `<option>` / populated `<select>`/`<optgroup>` (the oracle emits closure
    calls / `<!>` anchors there), template-expression comments, and every
    `$`-prefixed identifier reference or call outside the sanctioned rewrites
    below (a store **read** — `$name` whose `$`-stripped base is a binding — in a
    template OR script position is sanctioned, emitting `$.store_get`; a store
    **write** `$name = v` / **update** `$name++` in a script or dropped-handler
    position is sanctioned too, emitting `$.store_set` / `$.update_store` — see
    `store_rewrite.rs`; a store **member** write (`$obj.x = 5` → `$.store_mutate`),
    a store **destructuring** write (`[$count] = …` → an IIFE), and a subscription
    whose base is bound in a nested scope (`store_invalid_scoped_subscription`)
    still refuse) — return `CompileError::Unsupported` with a
    clear description, never
    guessed output. Within the supported blocks, nested `{#each}` (unreproducible
    unique-name order), a root-level `{@const}`, a destructured `{@const}`, a
    `{@const}` shadowing a `$derived` binding, a member/call rooted at a
    prop/import that is also shadowed in a nested scope (`needs_context`
    classification ambiguous), and a leading comment glued to the `<script>` line
    also refuse. Carried script comments alongside a template block, a component
    invocation, an expression-valued attribute, `{#snippet}`/`{@render}`, or
    hoisted imports **compile** — those emitters write template-region spans only,
    which no script-comment window reaches.
    The output is **self-validated by reparse** before it returns: generated JS
    that `tsv_ts` rejects surfaces as `CompileError::CorruptOutput` (a compiler
    bug — a divergent shape slipped every guard), never a silently invalid
    module. Always on — the reparse costs ~13% of the compile itself (release,
    measured over the fixture corpus; single-digit microseconds per component).
    Reach: it catches output the parser *rejects* (nested `export`, mis-built
    syntax). Output that parses as TypeScript (a passed-through annotation) is
    NOT a parse rejection — that class is caught by the second, independent
    self-check: `erase` is re-run over the finished program, and its
    `None`-means-unchanged contract makes "no change" a *proof* that no
    TypeScript-only node survived (`CompileError::TypeErasureLeak` otherwise).
    Both halves of the erasure — the script `Program` and each template
    expression at its borrow point — run before it, so **any** survivor is a
    compiler bug; it is what makes a missed borrow point loud rather than
    silent.
  - `canonicalize_js(source) -> Result<String, CanonicalizeError>` — the
    canonicalizer (below). Lives here because the compiler's own output
    idempotence checks and the oracle comparison both consume it.
- `refusal.rs` — the typed catalog of refusal reasons: every declined shape is
  a `Refusal` variant carried by `CompileError::Unsupported`, with a `Display`
  message (the human-readable reason `docs/checklist_svelte_compiler.md`
  quotes) and a stable `bucket_key` the corpus runner groups by directly
  (user-chosen names collapse to a `{placeholder}` so e.g. every event
  attribute shares one bucket). The single source of truth for the refusal
  contract.
- `parity.rs` — **the comment-position-tolerant parity comparator**
  (`compare_canonical` → `Parity`). The compiler's parity bar over two canonical JS
  strings: byte-exact, or tolerated when they differ ONLY in comment *position*
  (same code, same comment sequence, no bundler annotation). See §The Parity Bar.
- `namespace.rs` — **the SSR namespace inference** (Svelte's `infer_namespace` /
  `check_nodes_for_namespace` / `determine_namespace_for_children`): the `svg`/`mathml`/`html`
  namespace of each fragment, threaded through emission so the whitespace pass removes
  collapsed inter-node whitespace under `svg` (matching the oracle). Also the
  ancestor-aware `element_is_svg`/`element_is_mathml` classifiers the whitespace,
  attribute-case, and spread-flag paths share (the `<a>`/`<title>` cases are svg only
  under an svg ancestor).
- `erase.rs` — **TypeScript type erasure**, the compiler's `remove_typescript_nodes`:
  a tree→tree pre-pass over the instance script's `Program` producing a type-free
  statement list, run BEFORE every analysis pass and before codegen (the oracle's
  phase-1 placement). Structural sharing via an `Option<T>` return — `None` means
  *unchanged*, so a subtree with no TypeScript beneath it is never rebuilt and
  nothing is allocated; a rebuilt node shallow-clones (children are `&'arena T`,
  so pointers move, never subtrees). The `Statement` and `Expression` matches are
  **exhaustive, no catch-all** — a new AST variant fails compilation here rather
  than silently passing TypeScript through, and `TSType`'s 23 variants are never
  visited (they hang off the dropped `Option` fields). That exhaustiveness plus
  the `None` contract is the whole safety argument: re-running the eraser over the
  *finished* program and getting no change PROVES no TypeScript survived — the one
  check that catches a missed erase, which the output reparse cannot (a surviving
  annotation still parses). Refuse-don't-erase for the runtime-bearing constructs
  and the ones the oracle mis-compiles (see `refusal.rs`); every erased source
  region is recorded, and a comment intersecting one refuses — because the
  oracle's surviving-comment placement is an emergent artifact of its printer's
  flush points over stale spans, not a portable rule. The window widens on **both**
  sides: forward to the next surviving token (so `let x: Foo /* c */ = v` counts),
  and backward to the previous one for a region *detached* from it (a `return_type`
  after `)`, an `implements` clause, a `<T>` list — the printer never queries the
  erased node's range, but the enclosing node's gap window still spans it, so the
  comment would otherwise print anyway, twice for `implements`). A whole-statement
  drop deliberately does **not** reach backward: a JSDoc above an erased `interface`
  survives onto the next statement, exactly where the oracle puts it.
  `erase_expression` is the per-expression entry point the **template's borrow
  points** use (`transform_server`'s `EmitEnv::erase`): every TypeScript-bearing
  markup position is a `tsv_ts` `Expression` reached through a small set of
  borrows, so erasure applies at the borrow and **the Svelte AST is never
  rebuilt**. The erased node is what every consumer of that borrow reads — the
  emitted argument, the static-fold gate beside it (a raw `x as T` would fold to
  UNKNOWN where the oracle folds `x`: a silent under-fold, not a refusal), and
  the shape predicates that switch on a node's variant.
- `build.rs` — synthetic-AST constructors over the **hybrid appendix buffer**:
  the print buffer is the host `.svelte` source plus an appendix of minted
  lexemes. Borrowed user subtrees keep their real host spans; minted
  literal/template-quasi text lives in the appendix at the spans the nodes
  claim; synthetic identifiers ride the interned-name channel
  (`IdentName { escaped: Some(symbol), raw_len: 0 }`, source-free — `ident_at`
  places one at a caller-chosen span, either fictional-low so header comment
  windows stay empty, or *stolen* from the node it replaces so authored gaps
  survive). Codegen owns zero precedence knowledge — the printer's
  `needs_parens` handles it.
- `analyze.rs` — the script binding table and the **static-evaluation port**:
  the oracle folds statically-known template expressions into the emitted text,
  so parity needs the same fold decision. The evaluator mirrors the oracle's
  abstract interpreter over a bounded domain (strings, f64, booleans,
  null/undefined + the STRING/NUMBER/FUNCTION/UNKNOWN sentinels) and refuses
  (`Gray`) anything it can't bound byte-exactly (the oracle's globals tables,
  string→number coercion, non-integer number stringification, …). Bindings
  mirror the oracle: props/updated/no-initial are UNKNOWN; rune inits evaluate
  through to their argument; shadowed names go `Opaque` (refuse-on-spine). Also
  hosts the statement-position rune-call recognizers `is_effect_call` and
  `is_inspect_call` (the latter matching a bare `$inspect(args)` or a single
  `$inspect(args).with(cb)`) that the script rewrite's drops key on.
- `rune_guard.rs` — the rune refusal walk plus the collection passes riding the
  same exhaustive traversal: refuses any `$`-prefixed identifier reference or
  `$`-rooted call outside the sanctioned rewrites — the sanctioned set now
  includes a `$bindable(fallback?)` default at a top-level `$props()` property, a
  statement-position `$inspect(…)`, the `$state.snapshot(x)` and `$props.id()`
  declarator inits, a template-position `$state.snapshot(x)` (→ `$.snapshot`,
  `fragment.rs`), and a **store access** (`$name` where the `$`-stripped base is a
  binding and not a rune — a bare reference OR a call/new **callee root** `$fn()` /
  `$obj.m()` / `new $C()`, via `store_read_exemption` shared by the identifier,
  call, and new arms), which the guard now EXEMPTS in a script or dropped
  position when the caller opts in via `WalkCtx::allow_store_reads` (a
  template-position store read is exempted by `fragment.rs`'s value walk before it
  reaches the guard) — the store rewrite (`store_rewrite.rs`) or a dropped-region
  drop handles it. So the guard exempts those positions while still refusing every
  other `$bindable`/`$inspect`/`$state.snapshot`/`$props.id` (value/template
  positions, nested defaults, a wrong-arity or second `.with`, `$inspect.trace`, a
  nested-scope / optional-chained rune, …), a store read reaching the
  **template-value** or **pattern** guard (an unsupported wrapper position, where
  the caller passes no store exemption), a **shadowed** store base in a
  dropped-region position (`store_invalid_scoped_subscription`), and a
  `$name` whose base is not a binding (the oracle's `global_reference_invalid`) —
  refuses a derived-binding
  read no rewrite turns into `d()` — a pattern default, a read under an
  unsupported wrapper, or an escaped-identifier read whose decoded name is a
  `$derived` binding; a **script-position** read is EXEMPT when the caller opts in
  (`allow_derived_reads`, the script-body guards — the read is rewritten by
  `store_rewrite`), while a **write** to a derived binding (`d = v` / `d++`, out of
  scope — the oracle lowers it to `d(v)` / `$.update_derived(d)`) refuses on every
  path. Also refuses top-level `await`, and collects
  assignment/update roots (`updated`) and nested-scope declarations (shadow
  candidates) for the evaluator. Exhaustive matches on purpose — new AST
  variants fail compilation here instead of silently skipping the guard.
- `needs_context.rs` — the `needs_context` analysis (ports Svelte's phase-2
  accumulation): does the component require the
  `$$renderer.component(($$renderer) => …)` wrapper? Walks the whole un-folded
  instance + template AST (exhaustive matches) and sets the flag on any `new`
  expression, or a member/call whose root (`is_safe_identifier`) is not a plain
  identifier or is a prop/import binding — a plain local, a global, and rune
  bindings stay safe. A member/call rooted at a prop/import that is *also* bound
  in a nested scope is ambiguous for this name-based port and refuses, as does one
  rooted at an escaped identifier (classification not ported). Descends
  into `{#snippet}` bodies (a function-like subtree — a `new`/prop-rooted access
  there still fires the flag) and `{@render}` arguments. Also computes
  `uses_stores` in the same whole-component walk — the oracle's analysis-driven
  store-subscription gate: any valid `$name` store reference *anywhere* (read or
  write, emitted or dropped — an event handler, `{:catch}`) sets it, so the
  `var $$store_subs;` / `$.unsubscribe_stores(…)` injection fires for a store used
  only in a dropped handler too. It is decided here, NOT at emission time.
- `store_rewrite.rs` — **store-access (and script-position `$derived` read)
  rewriting** for the instance script (the
  script analog of `fragment.rs`'s template value walk). A tree→tree pass over the
  FINAL synthetic body (after erasure + rune rewrites, so a read inside a
  `$.derived(() => …)` thunk is reached) with `erase.rs`'s `Option<T>`
  structural-sharing shape and exhaustive matches: a store **read** `$name` →
  `$.store_get(…)` at any depth; an **assignment** `$name = v` → `$.store_set(name,
  v)` and a compound `$name += v` → `$.store_set(name, $.store_get(…) + v)`
  (reconstructing the binary the oracle's `build_assignment_value` produces); an
  **update** `$name++`/`++$name`/`$name--`/`--$name` → `$.update_store[_pre]((…),
  '$name', name[, -1])`. It also rewrites a plain **`$derived` read** → `d()` (the
  script analog of the template value walk's bare-derived rewrite — a top-level
  initializer, a function body, a `$.derived(() => …)` thunk; the minted `d()`
  takes the callee's **tight** span so it never sweeps a carried script comment). A
  binding-position id (`let d = …`) is skipped, and a **write** to a derived
  (`d = v` / `d++`) and a *shadowed* derived name are refused upstream (the rune
  guard and `compile_server`), so they never reach the pass. Refuses a store member
  write (`$obj.x = 5`), a store destructuring
  write (`[$count] = …`), and a shadowed store base (`store_invalid_scoped_subscription`,
  `store_shadowed` = `nested_declared` ∪ `component.fn_declared`). Respects
  **name-only positions** (a non-computed member property / object-or-class key is
  a name, never a read) — the one place it diverges from `erase.rs`. Builders live
  in `build.rs` (`store_set`, `update_store`, sharing `store_subs_assign`/
  `store_base_value` with `store_get`; `call_expr` for the `d()` read).
- `snippet.rs` — the `{#snippet}` hoist analysis (name-based port of Svelte's
  `can_hoist_snippet`): which top-level snippets go to true module scope. Collects
  each snippet's free references (a flat scope-tracking walk) minus its bound
  names; a free reference to an instance binding (prop/`$state`/`$derived`/plain
  top-level decl — *not* imports/globals) blocks hoisting, and a name that is both
  an instance binding and a nested local is ambiguous and refuses. Hoistability is
  a fixpoint over snippet-to-snippet references. Also collects every snippet name
  (render-callee classification, generated-name collisions).
- `attr_refs.rs` — the **shared template traversals**, so no analysis hand-writes
  its own walk and drifts (which is how the component-spread arm once existed in
  one and not the other). Three levels:
  - the element-attribute pair — `each_attribute_expression`, the emitted-path
    view (everything not refused at emission: plain values, a `{...spread}` on
    **either** element kind (a component's `$.spread_props` array element and a
    regular element's fused `$.attributes({ …spread })` object element both emit
    it), a
    `class:` / `style:` directive's expression-bearing value on a regular element
    (emitted as `$.attr_class` / `$.attr_style`), a `bind:` directive's target
    expression on a regular element (the oracle's analysis visits every bind
    expression regardless of SSR emission, so a snippet whose only instance-binding
    reference sits in a bind must not module-hoist),
    and the no-op drop family `use:`/`transition:`/`in:`/`out:`/`animate:`/`{@attach}`
    on a regular element, dropped-but-analyzed like an event handler; its
    `each_emitted_directive_name` companion surfaces the drop-family directive
    *names* plus a `style:` shorthand name an expression traversal can't reach; the
    refused positions — legacy `on:`/`let:` — are
    skipped, the refusal keeping their references out of output), and
    `each_reference_bearing_attribute_expression` (+ the directive-name and
    special-element entry points), the **dropped-fragment** view, which includes
    every position. An attribute shape that newly reaches emission must be added
    HERE so every analysis sees it at once;
  - `each_template_item`, the whole-fragment walk over the dropped-fragment view,
    yielding every borrowed expression (plus a `{#snippet}`'s `<T>` clause, which
    is TypeScript with no expression to yield). Its two consumers ask what a
    region *contains* rather than what it *emits* — the document-wide TypeScript
    gate and the rune guard over a dropped `{:catch}`. Exhaustively matched: a new
    template shape fails compilation rather than slipping past both;
  - `each_child_fragment`, the pure structural seam — the one
    exhaustively-matched answer to "which sub-fragments does this node contain"
    (element/special-element fragments, `{#if}` branches, `{#each}` body+fallback,
    `{#await}` pending/then/catch, `{#key}` fragment, `{#snippet}` body). The
    snippet-name collector and the element census recurse through it, so the
    recursion shape has a single home. A new `FragmentNode` variant, or a new child
    fragment on an existing variant, fails compilation HERE rather than drifting
    across hand-written copies. The
    scope-tracking / dropped-`{:catch}` walks (`needs_context.rs`, `snippet.rs`'s
    free-variable collector) keep their own exhaustive matches on purpose: their
    descent is entangled with per-node scope binding, the emission-vs-dropped
    distinction, and the `{#await}`-catch flag toggle, which a uniform enumeration
    can't carry without changing behavior.
  The SSR output **drops** four regions without visiting them — the `{#each}`
  key, the `{#key}` expression, an event-handler attribute, and the whole
  `{:catch}` branch — so no emission refusal can fire inside them. But the oracle
  decides TypeScript at *parse* time and rune placement at *analysis* time, both
  before it chooses what to emit, and it counts references wherever they sit. So
  a dropped region still gets all three walks (`transform_server`'s
  `refuse_template_typescript` / `guard_dropped_fragment`, and the analyses'
  dropped-fragment view) — but **not** the emission refusals, and not the
  derived-read rule, which is an emission rewrite rather than a validity rule.
- `transform_server.rs` — the SSR transform **orchestrator**: `compile_server`
  runs the phase-numbered pipeline (TypeScript erasure/gate, CSS scoping — the
  element census built and every selector chain matched against it **upfront** in
  `analyze()`, script analysis, snippet hoist analysis, script rewrite,
  `needs_context`, template emission, wrapping, assembly/print) and owns
  `EmitEnv`, the struct threaded through every emitter in the sibling modules
  below — the builder, the binding table, the derived-name set, the finished CSS
  scope (`CssScoping`, read-only — `element_scope` is a span lookup),
  block-scope overlays, snippet hoist state, and the erased-region windows
  every `EmitEnv::erase` call collects. Module scaffold: `import * as $ from
  'svelte/internal/server'`, then any instance-script `import` declarations
  hoisted to module scope in source order (an import inside the component
  function is invalid JS) + the exported component function. The whole body
  wraps in `$$renderer.component(($$renderer) => { … })` whenever
  `needs_context` fires (a dropped effect, the new/member/call analysis in
  `needs_context.rs`, or a non-empty `$bindable` set), which also forces the
  `$$props` parameter. A non-empty bindable set additionally emits
  `$.bind_props($$props, { … })` as the component body's last statement (a
  dropped `$inspect` never contributes here — its wrapper comes only from
  `needs_context`). Any valid store access (`EmitEnv::uses_stores`, computed
  upfront by `needs_context`, not at emission) injects
  `var $$store_subs;` as a component-body statement (after the `$props.id()` hoist,
  before the body) and `if ($$store_subs) $.unsubscribe_stores($$store_subs);` as
  the last statement (before any `$.bind_props`) — both at the component-body level
  and INDEPENDENT of the wrapper (a store access does not force `needs_context`).
  The script store rewrite (`store_rewrite.rs`) runs over the instance body between
  the rune-rewrite loop and `EmitEnv` construction, using the `store_names` /
  `store_shadowed` sets frozen there.
- `script_rewrite.rs` — the document-wide TypeScript flag and gate
  (`document_ts_flag`/`refuse_template_typescript`), the top-level
  binding-table analysis (`analyze_script`/`analyze_declarator`), and the
  per-statement rune rewrites (`rewrite_script_statement`) — `$props()` →
  `$$props` (span-stolen; a rest element in its pattern gains the oracle's
  `$$slots, $$events` injection immediately before it, and a non-destructured
  `let props = $props()` becomes `let { $$slots, $$events, ...props } =
  $$props` — a plain destructure without a rest gets no injection), a
  top-level `$props()` destructure default `= $bindable(fallback?)` → its
  fallback (`void 0` argument-less) with the bindable prop collected in source
  order for the trailing `$.bind_props($$props, { … })` (shorthand `{ key }`
  when the key equals its local, else `{ key: local }`),
  `$state(v)`/`$state.raw(v)` → `v` (`void 0` argument-less), `$derived(e)` →
  `$.derived(() => e)` — but the oracle's `b.thunk` runs `unthunk`, which
  collapses the arrow when its body is a call on a bare identifier whose
  arguments match its (empty) parameter list, so an argument-less call passes
  straight through (`$derived(get_library())` → `$.derived(get_library)`) —
  `$derived.by(f)` → `$.derived(f)`, statement-position
  `$effect`/`$effect.pre` dropped (forcing the wrapper) — statement-position
  `$inspect(args)` / `$inspect(args).with(cb)` (recognized by
  `analyze.rs::is_inspect_call`) also dropped, but WITHOUT forcing the wrapper
  (no `has_effects`): its arguments and `.with` callback are still guard-walked
  and its span pushed to `dropped_regions` (a comment inside refuses) — a
  `$props.id()` declarator SKIPPED (the transform hoists `const <name> =
  $.props_id($$renderer)` to the component body's first statement, forcing no
  wrapper; duplicate / non-identifier target / carried comment refuse) — a
  `$state.snapshot(x)` declarator UNWRAPPED to its argument `x` (like `$state`;
  both via `classify_rune_init`, which refuses an optional-chained init) — a
  **top-level class declaration** rewritten by `rewrite_class_state_fields`: each
  DIRECT non-static, non-computed `$state(v)`/`$state.raw(v)` field UNWRAPPED to `v`
  (a no-arg `field = $state()` → a BARE field, value dropped, NOT `void 0` — the
  divergence from the argless declarator), every other member (a `$derived`/static/
  computed rune field, a method body, a nested class/class expression) taking the
  normal refusing guard walk (`walk_class_member_guarded`) so the guard-exempt set
  equals the unwrap set — reach-matched by construction, no undefined-`$state` MISMATCH;
  a field whose WHOLE argument is a LONE reactive-binding identifier
  (`$state($count)` / `$state(d)`) REFUSES (`ClassFieldStateReactiveArg`,
  `is_lone_reactive_binding`) — the oracle keeps that lone store/`$derived` read BARE
  in the field, but the store rewrite descends into class bodies unconditionally and
  would rewrite the kept argument to `$.store_get(…)`/`d()`, so a compound
  (`$state($count + 1)`) or plain-var argument compiles while the lone case is a safe
  over-refusal — a
  multi-declarator top-level declaration
  splitting into one declaration per declarator, source order (the oracle's
  shape; nested declarations and for-heads stay joined; comments alongside a
  multi-declarator refuse — the oracle re-anchors them inside the split). Also
  `collect_script_comments`: instance-script comments carry through into the
  synthetic program (host-absolute spans; the imports print in a separate
  comment-free program, and the oracle relocates a script comment down into the
  component body — leading the first surviving statement — which the carry
  reproduces). Divergent placement classes still refuse — comments after the last
  script statement (the oracle re-attaches them into the template),
  template-expression comments, comments inside dropped rune regions, and comments
  alongside a rune rewrite that mints a **script-region** span a comment window
  would sweep (`$derived` — the `$.derived(() => e)` thunk — and argument-less
  `$state()`). A template block, a component invocation, an expression-valued
  attribute, `{#snippet}`/`{@render}`, and hoisted imports emit **template-region**
  spans only, so a carried comment window can't reach them and they compile. Also
  `self_check_no_typescript`, the type-erasure self-check that closes the
  loop on the finished program (see `erase.rs`).
- `fragment.rs` — the per-fragment walk (`emit_fragment`) and its
  `BodyBuilder` accumulator (alternating static text and interpolation
  expressions, flushed into a `$$renderer.push(…)` statement). Static
  emission implements the oracle's normalization, derived from Svelte's own
  `clean_nodes`/`escape_html` and probe-verified: whitespace-only boundary
  text drops and edge runs trim per fragment; a text edge run abutting a
  non-text node collapses to one space (runs abutting `{expr}` stay — text +
  expression count as one text); interior whitespace is verbatim;
  `<pre>`/`<textarea>` preserve everything; a text-first fragment (component
  root or `{#each}` body — the oracle's `is_text_first` parent set) gets a
  `<!---->` prefix. `{expr}` → `$.escape(expr)` (a derived read, bare or nested,
  becomes `d()`; known evaluations fold as static text), `{@html expr}` →
  `$.html(expr)`; entities decode then re-escape (`[&<]` in text). The
  `guard_dropped`/`guard_pattern`/`guard_dropped_fragment`/`wrap_single`/
  `wrap_value_expr` family prepares a borrowed template expression for a
  synthetic call argument slot, guarding stray runes and rewriting a derived
  read (bare or nested) to `d()`. `wrap_value_expr`'s core `rewrite_template_value`
  is the **item-6 template-value substitution walk**: it rewrites every read of a
  `$derived` binding — bare (`{d}`) or nested at any depth (`{d + 1}`, `{obj[d]}`,
  `{f(d)}`, `{d.x}`) — to `d()`, every `$state.snapshot(x)` sub-node to
  `$.snapshot(<processed x>)`, and every **store read** — a `$name` whose
  `$`-stripped base is a binding and not a rune (`bare_store_read`), NOT shadowed by a
  block-local overlay (a shadowed base is the oracle's
  `store_invalid_scoped_subscription`, left for the guard to refuse) — to
  `$.store_get(($$store_subs ??= {}), '$name', name)` (the store value reads `name()`
  when `name` is a `$derived`, the store the derived currently holds; the
  `var $$store_subs` / `$.unsubscribe_stores` injection is decided upfront by
  `needs_context`'s `uses_stores`, NOT flagged here; a store read in a top-level
  `{#snippet}` also blocks its module-hoist — `snippet.rs`),
  rebuilding only the spine down to each rewrite target
  (a `contains_rewrite_target` fast-path keeps target-free subtrees on the unchanged
  guarded path, byte-identical, and `contains_rewrite_target`/`rebuild_value` stay in
  lockstep on one node set). A derived read or snapshot under a node kind the walk
  does not descend (an object literal, an arrow, a tagged template) or a pattern
  default is left for the guard, which refuses it (a safe over-refusal); a
  **script-position** derived read is instead rewritten to `d()` by `store_rewrite`
  (not refused).
- `blocks.rs` — **control-flow blocks** split the single template into
  multiple `$$renderer.push(…)` statements, each block emitting its own
  statements between flushes and merging its closer/opener into the adjacent
  template: `{#if}` is a flat `if … else if … else` chain with per-branch
  single-quote-string anchor pushes (`<!--[N-->`, terminal `<!--[-1-->`,
  synthesized when `{:else}` is absent) and a merge-forward `<!--]-->` closer;
  `{#each}` is `const each_array = $.ensure_array_like(expr)` + a `for` loop
  binding `let CTX = each_array[IDX]` (both `each_array`/`$$index` names
  advance once per each block in source order, `$$length` fixed), the opener
  `<!--[-->` merging backward without `{:else}` or, with it, `each_array`
  hoisting before an `if (each_array.length !== 0) { … } else { … }` whose
  openers are string pushes; `{#await}` is a 4-arg
  `$.await($$renderer, expr, () => {pending}, (value?) => {then})` (empty
  `() => {}` fallbacks; `{:catch}` dropped) + a merge-forward closer; `{#key}`
  is a `<!---->` marker, a bare `{ … }` block, and a closing `<!---->` (key
  expression guard-walked then dropped, like an each key); `{@const}` hoists a
  `const` declaration to the top of its branch body and enters the evaluator's
  innermost block-scope overlay so later reads fold. Each/await locals and the
  `{:then}` value mask to UNKNOWN in that overlay; a block body that shadows a
  `$derived` name refuses. `<svelte:head>` emits `$.head(hash, $$renderer,
  ($$renderer) => { … })`.
- `snippet_emit.rs` — **snippets/render**: a `{#snippet}` becomes a
  `function name($$renderer, ...params) { … }` — hoisted to true module scope
  (its own program between imports and export) when `snippet.rs` deems it
  hoistable, else to its nearest enclosing block scope's init (a block-scope
  fragment collects the snippets of its whole element subtree and emits them
  first; parameters mask to UNKNOWN). A `{@render callee(args)}` becomes
  `callee($$renderer, ...args)` (`?.` preserved) with a trailing `<!---->` anchor
  unless the enclosing block's sole trimmed child is this render with a
  non-dynamic (local-snippet) callee — the `is_standalone` flag, inherited by
  element children.
- `element.rs` — element and component emission: `emit_element` prints
  static HTML (void elements close `/>`) and routes a component invocation
  (`<Foo … />`) to `emit_component`, which builds the `Foo($$renderer,
  {…props})` call — a plain object literal, or `$.spread_props([…])` when a
  `{...spread}` attribute is present — the implicit `children` snippet prop
  for default-slot content, and named `{#snippet}` children as named snippet
  props (`$$slots: { key: true, … }` alongside). A regular element carrying a
  `{...spread}` routes its WHOLE attribute set through `emit_spread_attributes`
  → one fused `$.attributes(object, css_hash, classes, styles, flags)` call
  (`<name${$.attributes(…)}>`): `build_element_spread_object` builds the
  source-order object (plain attributes via `attribute::build_spread_object_property`,
  a `bind:` core kind's synthesized `value`/`checked` property at its slot via
  `attribute::build_bind_object_property`, spreads as `...expr`), the scope hash
  rides `css_hash` (the element is scoped when any scoped compound — type/id/
  class/attribute/universal — matches it, a lookup via `EmitEnv::element_scope` into
  the upfront-matched `CssScoping` table), the `class:` directives ride
  `classes` (`attribute::build_spread_class_object` — identifier keys + shorthand)
  and the `style:` directives ride `styles`
  (`attribute::build_spread_style_object` — a FLAT object, no `|important`
  partition), `<input>` / a custom element (hyphenated tag or `is`
  attribute) set `flags` (`4` / `2`), and `elide_call_args` applies the oracle's
  `b.call` elision (trailing `void 0` dropped, interior padded). A co-present
  `on:`/`let:`, a `<select>`, or a load-error element refuses; the drop family is
  guarded-and-dropped. The non-spread path
  (`emit_plain_attributes`) pre-scans a
  regular element's `class:` and `style:` directives and defers them to
  `attribute::emit_class_directives` / `attribute::emit_style_directives` (each
  fused at its authored-`class`/`style` slot, or after all plain attributes when
  synthetic — the synthetic `class` before the synthetic `style`), and handles a
  `bind:` directive inline at its source slot via `attribute::emit_bind_directive`.
  A **`<svelte:element this={…}>`** compiles to a statement-level
  `$.element($$renderer, TAG, attrsFn?, childrenFn?)` call (`emit_svelte_element`,
  routed from `fragment.rs` like a component): the TAG is the `'div'` literal
  (`this="div"`, parser-collapsed for a mixed value) or the erased/derived-rewritten
  expression (`this={expr}`), and the attributes/children are rendered into
  parameterless closures over the enclosing `$$renderer`. The attribute machinery is
  **shared** with regular elements via an `AttrHost::{Regular, Dynamic}` enum threaded
  through `emit_plain_attributes` / `emit_spread_attributes` /
  `build_element_spread_object` (so the two never drift): passing
  `name = "svelte:element"` makes the name-keyed guards fall through (never void /
  `<select>` / load-error / custom), and the only forks are the `bind:` handling (a
  `<svelte:element>` validates a `bind:this` via `attribute::validate_dynamic_bind`
  and refuses every other bind) and the spread `flags` argument (always absent — a
  dynamic tag is never `<input>`/custom). A `<svelte:element>` in a component with a
  scoping `<style>` is **CSS-scoped** like a regular element: the element census
  holds it as a leaf and owner, a type/universal selector matches it unconditionally,
  and `emit_svelte_element` synthesizes the hash class into its attributes closure
  (`env.special_element_scope`). Deferred as safe refusals: a `slot="…"` on a
  `<svelte:element>` component child (would MISROUTE the `FragmentNode::Element`-only
  named-slot detection), a legacy `on:`/`let:` (the runes-only fence), and
  `bind:focused`/the `omit_in_ssr` family.
- `attribute.rs` — attribute emission: dynamic and mixed attributes →
  `$.attr(name, expr[, true])` / `$.attr_class` / `$.attr_style` with
  `$.stringify` interpolations (a mixed attribute whose every part folds
  statically emits a *static* attribute instead — attr-escaped `[&"<]`,
  folded value verbatim: no trim, no empty-class drop, boolean attributes
  keep the folded value; single-expression attributes never fold). Static
  text values inline: entities re-escape (`[&"<]` in static attributes);
  boolean attributes emit `name=""`; `class`/`style` values collapse+trim,
  and a string-valued `class` that collapses+trims to empty is dropped
  entirely (static path only — bare `class` keeps `class=""`, empty
  `style`/`id` stay). Also `emit_class_directives` — a regular element's
  `class:name={expr}` directives fuse with the authored `class` attribute (or
  the phase-2 synthetic empty `''`) into `$.attr_class(base, css_hash, { name:
  expr, … })` (the oracle's `build_attr_class`): the base is the static value /
  `$.clsx(expr)` / `''`; the scope hash concatenates into a string-literal base
  or rides the 2nd argument; the element is scoped when any scoped compound
  matches it (`EmitEnv::element_scope`, a lookup into the upfront-matched
  `CssScoping` table) — a type/id/attribute selector, not only a class token or
  `class:` name. A mixed-value
  `class="a {b}"` base refuses
  (`ClassDirectiveWithMixedClass`). And `emit_style_directives` — the `style:`
  analog (the oracle's `build_attr_style`): `$.attr_style(base, directives)`, TWO
  arguments (no css-hash — style is never scoped). The base mirrors the class base
  MINUS `$.clsx` (a dynamic `style={expr}` is the bare expression) and MINUS
  scoping; `directives` is a plain object `{ name: value, … }` or, when any
  directive carries `|important`, the 2-element `[ {normal}, {important} ]` array
  (empty `{}` normal object when all are important; source order within each
  group). Keys lowercase unless `--`-prefixed, then bare-identifier-or-quoted;
  values are the expression / a static literal / a shorthand's same-name
  identifier (object-shorthand `{ color }`). A mixed-value `style="a {b}"` base
  refuses (`StyleDirectiveWithMixedStyle`), a mixed directive value
  `style:x="a {b}"` refuses (`StyleDirectiveWithMixedValue`), and any modifier but
  a single `|important` refuses (`StyleDirectiveInvalidModifier`). `element.rs`'s
  attribute loop pre-scans the `class:` and `style:` directives and calls these at
  the authored slot (or after all plain attributes when synthetic). Also
  `emit_bind_directive` — a `bind:` **core kind** on a regular element, emitted
  inline at its source slot (delegating to `resolve_bind_directive`, the validity
  fork the spread `build_bind_object_property` shares so the two never drift):
  `bind:this` omits (any variable, any element — no
  `$state` gate), but only for a valid bind target (an Identifier/member chain or a
  `{get, set}` pair); a non-lvalue target (a call/literal/logical) refuses
  (`bind_invalid_expression`). `bind:value` on `<input>` → `$.attr('value', expr)`;
  `bind:checked` on a static
  `<input type="checkbox">` → `$.attr('checked', expr, true)`; `bind:group` on a
  static-`type` `<input>` → a synthesized `$.attr('checked', <synth>, true)` where
  `<synth>` is `group.includes(<value>)` (checkbox) / `group === <value>`
  (radio/other), `<value>` the companion `value` attribute's value (still emitted at
  its own slot; no companion → the oracle silently drops the bind). The bind TARGET
  is gated to a `$state`-rooted `Identifier`/member chain (the crate's one supported
  bindable — the SAFE side of the oracle's assignable-lvalue rule); every other
  `bind:` (non-`<input>` target, `value` on `<textarea>`/`<select>`, `omit_in_ssr`
  media/dimension binds, `bind:open`, the content-editable trio, an invalid
  target/type, a non-`$state` target) refuses via `Refusal::BindDirective { name }`.
  Also `build_attribute_value_expr` — the object-path value builder the element
  `{...spread}` object uses (the oracle's `build_attribute_value`, `is_component`
  false): boolean → `true`, single Text → HTML-escaped literal, single expression
  → the bare erased/wrapped value (`class` wrapped in `$.clsx` per `needs_clsx`),
  mixed → a folded (un-HTML-escaped) literal or `$.stringify` template — sharing
  the fold-or-template loop (`build_mixed_attr_value`) with `emit_mixed_attribute`,
  which alone HTML-escapes and pushes the full-fold static form. And
  `build_spread_object_property` — one `key: value` object property from a plain
  attribute (key lowercased, `shorthand` on a same-named identifier value), `None`
  for a dropped attribute (a single-expression event handler — still guarded — and
  `defaultValue`/`defaultChecked`). And the three spread-directive builders:
  `build_bind_object_property` (a `bind:` core kind's `value`/`checked` property via
  the shared `resolve_bind_directive` — `bind:this`/a no-companion `bind:group` yield
  `None`, and an `omit_in_ssr` bind **refuses** on both the spread and inline paths, a
  safe over-refusal), `build_spread_class_object` (the `classes` argument —
  identifier keys, case-preserved, with the object-shorthand collapse the oracle's
  `b.init` applies, checked on the RAW directive expression), and
  `build_spread_style_object` (the `styles` argument — a FLAT object, `|important`
  validated but NOT partitioned, reusing `build_style_property`).
- `element_census.rs` — the **upfront element census** (`ElementCensus`): one
  top-down walk over `root.fragment`, run in `analyze()`, producing a
  `CensusElement` per scoping candidate — a regular HTML element or a
  `<svelte:element>` (components excluded, matching the oracle's element list, which
  holds `RegularElement`/`SvelteElement`) — with an ancestor/sibling `path`, the
  upward navigability the Svelte AST lacks, and the substrate the combinator matcher
  navigates (`get_ancestor_elements` for descendant/child,
  `get_possible_element_siblings` / `get_possible_nested_siblings` / `loop_child` for
  `+`/`~`, with block-descent and the `{#each}` self-adjacency wrap-around). Each
  candidate is a `CensusNode { Regular(&Element), Dynamic(&SpecialElement) }`
  projecting both element types onto one leaf test; a `<svelte:element>` differs only
  in that a type selector matches it unconditionally (its runtime tag is unknown) and,
  as a possible sibling, it only PROBABLY exists (so it never triggers the `+`
  adjacent early-stop and carries no slot check — `css-prune.js:1041`/`1215`).
  Descends every SSR-reachable fragment (element/component/`<svelte:element>`
  subtrees, `{#if}` / `{#each}` / `{#await}`-pending+then / `{#key}` / `{#snippet}`
  bodies, `<svelte:head>`) but **not** `{:catch}` (dropped from output), so the census
  leaf set equals the emitted set — keeping the single-compound match byte-identical to
  the pre-census emission-fused result.
- `css_scope.rs` — CSS scoping: parses a rule's selector into a CHAIN of compounds
  (type / id / class / attribute / universal + trailing pseudo, joined by
  combinators), then matches the chain BACKWARD against the element census
  (`match_scope` → `apply_selector` / `apply_combinator`, a port of the oracle's
  `css-prune.js`; the leaf reuses the joint-AND predicate list —
  `relative_selector_might_apply_to_node` / `attribute_matches` — over a `CensusNode`,
  so a type selector matches a `<svelte:element>` unconditionally while id/class/
  attribute selectors route through its real attribute list). Every compound a
  match reaches gains the `svelte-tsvhash` class and every element the match touches
  is scoped (`CssScoping.scoped_elements`, read by `EmitEnv::element_scope` /
  `EmitEnv::special_element_scope`); the
  compound is **source-spliced** (appended after the last non-pseudo anchor, or
  replacing a bare `*`) — author whitespace preserved, not reprinted — with a
  per-`ComplexSelector` specificity bump (the first scoped compound a plain
  `.svelte-tsvhash`, each later one a zero-specificity `:where(.svelte-tsvhash)`,
  reset per comma `ComplexSelector`). **Supported**: the four combinators
  (descendant / child / `+` / `~`, including block-descent and the `{#each}`
  wrap-around) and basic `:global` (leading `:global(<compound>) .y`, trailing
  `:global(<compound>)`, a fully-global `:global(<compound>)`, and the bare
  `:global` combinator `div :global.x` → `div.x`). **Refused**: `:global{}` global
  blocks (nested rules), `:is`/`:where`/`:has`/`:not`, `:root`/`:host`, nesting, the
  `||` column combinator, a snippet/render-crossing combinator path (`CssCombinatorSelector`
  — the site-resolution product isn't built, a safe over-refusal), at-rules /
  `@keyframes` (`CssAtRule`), empty rules (`CssEmptyRule`), an enumerable dynamic
  attribute value (`CssDynamicAttributeMatch`), a non-ASCII case-insensitive operand
  (`CssCaseInsensitiveNonAscii`), and a chain matching no element
  (`CssSelectorNoMatch`).

Types: `CompileOptions { generate: Generate, dev: bool }` (default: `Server`,
non-dev), `CompileOutput { js, css, warnings }`, `CompileWarning { code, message }`
(minimal for now), and the two error enums (`CompileError`'s two bug variants —
`CorruptOutput` and `TypeErasureLeak` — are the compiler's two self-checks firing).

## The Canonicalizer Contract

`canonicalize_js` parses JavaScript as a strict module (`tsv_ts::Goal::Module`)
and reprints it through `tsv_ts::format_canonical`, which erases newline-derived
*authoring intent*:

- **blank lines are dropped** between statements;
- **expansion heuristics are off** — a construct that fits the print width
  collapses to one line whether or not the source had a newline after its opening
  delimiter; it breaks only when width forces it;
- **comments are preserved** in content and relative order, never dropped or
  merged; only their placement is normalized deterministically (an own-line
  comment may become a trailing comment of the preceding node). A construct
  carrying a `//` line comment before more content stays broken — trailing the
  comment onto a continuing line would swallow that content (inside a template
  interpolation it even makes the output unparseable), so comment presence
  overrides collapse there.

Two guarantees follow. **Idempotence**: canonicalizing an already-canonical string
reproduces it. **Authoring-independence**: two programs that differ only in
incidental whitespace reprint to the same string. Together these make a byte
difference between two canonical forms either a genuine code difference or a comment
*position* difference — the substrate the parity bar (below) refines.

The output is self-validated: `canonicalize_js` reparses its own reprint before
returning and surfaces a rejection as `CanonicalizeError::CorruptOutput` — a
canonicalizer bug is loud, never a silently corrupt comparison string.

Real content is *not* intent and survives verbatim: a newline inside a template
literal, a multi-line string via line continuation, and a mapped type's source
multi-line-ness (a deliberate un-erased residual — see the `format_canonical` seam
notes in `tsv_ts`).

## The Parity Bar (comment-position-tolerant)

The compiler is measured against Svelte's `compile()` on the *canonical reprint* of
both sides, but the bar is **not raw byte-equality** — it tolerates a comment
**position** difference (`parity::compare_canonical` → `Parity::{Exact,
CommentPosition, Divergent}`, re-exported as `compare_canonical`/`Parity`). Two
canonical forms count as parity when they differ ONLY in where comments sit — **same
code, same comment sequence, no bundler annotation involved**. Everything else (a
code difference, a dropped / doubled / reordered / content-changed comment) stays
`Divergent` = a MISMATCH = a bug.

Why: tsv preserves the author's comment placement (its comment philosophy — a
deliberate, cataloged divergence from prettier), while Svelte's printer (esrap)
relocates comments across operator/conditional boundaries the way prettier does. The
two then place the *same* comment on *different* AST nodes — genuinely different
bytes, but not a difference in the compiled **code**. Comment position in
machine-consumed compiled output carries no correctness signal, so pinning it would
flag cosmetic differences as bugs (and force refusing every comment tsv places its
own way). The relaxation aligns the bar with what matters — code + comment presence
+ semantic-comment binding.

The comparison (only on the byte-inequality failure path — the common case stays a
fast `==`):

1. **Same code** — clear `program.comments` on both parses and byte-compare the
   comment-free reprints (a comment-forced break vanishes with its comment, so
   same-code programs reprint identically). Soundness reduces to canonicalizer
   injectivity-on-code, which `canonicalize:audit` gates independently.
2. **Same comments** — the comment *sequence* (output order, exact content) must
   match, so a drop / double-print / reorder / content change is `Divergent`.
3. **Annotation guard** — a bundler annotation (`/* @__PURE__ */`, `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__`,
   webpack/vite magic comments) is NOT position-neutral (moving it changes
   tree-shaking), so its presence falls back to strict byte-equality. JSDoc casts
   are safe — erasure unwraps every `JsdocCast` to a plain comment.

The relaxation is confined to the JS leg: CSS parity stays byte-exact, and the
fixture validator's oracle-freshness / expected-idempotence checks stay strict (a
comment-position-divergent fixture records the *oracle's* placement in
`expected_server.js`; ours is tolerated). The corpus runner surfaces the tolerated
count in a separate `comment_position` bucket so the tolerance is never silent.
