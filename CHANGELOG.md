# tsv changelog

Covers the npm packages published from this repo — `@fuzdev/tsv_format_wasm`,
`@fuzdev/tsv_parse_wasm`, and `@fuzdev/tsv_wasm`. All move together at the
`Cargo.toml [workspace.package]` version. `deno task publish --wetrun --bump <level>`
converts the `## Unreleased` section into the released version's section.

## Unreleased

- init
- add `@fuzdev/tsv_wasm` — the full tool (format + parse) in one package, with a
  `tsv` bin (`format` + `parse` subcommands mirroring the native CLI's flags and
  exit codes; single-threaded WASM — `--jobs` is accepted and ignored)
- slim `@fuzdev/tsv_parse_wasm` to parse-only (the `format_*` exports and their
  printers move to `@fuzdev/tsv_wasm`; wasm drops from ~2.9 MB to ~1.7 MB raw,
  ~895 KB to ~515 KB gzipped)
